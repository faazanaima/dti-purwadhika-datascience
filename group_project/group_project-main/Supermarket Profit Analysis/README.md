# Optimizing Profit: Strategic Consideration of Discounts and Sales Trends

The project presents an analysis of supermarket profits, focusing on sales trends, discount strategies, and regional performance from 2016 to 2019 in the United States. The project included several steps, such as:

1) Data Insights
The dataset comprises 9,994 transactions, revealing a mean sales figure of $229.86 and a mean profit of $28.66, with the West region leading in both sales and profit, while Office Supplies emerged as the top product category.

2) Sales and Profit Trends
Sales peak during September, November, and December, attributed to the holiday season and significant discounts like Black Friday. Profit trends mirror sales trends, with similar peaks noted in the same months.

3) Regional Analysis
The West region contributes the most to profits, while the Central region, despite high sales, yields the least profit due to a higher reliance on discounts (averaging 25%). This demographic difference suggests that customers in the West are willing to purchase with minimal discounts (around 10%).

4) Category Performance
Office Supplies is identified as the best-selling category, closely followed by Furniture, which unfortunately leads to losses due to high average discounts (17.5%). The analysis indicates that discounts exceeding 20% correlate with profit losses, emphasizing the need for a reevaluation of discount strategies.

5) Recommendations
To enhance profitability, the report suggests limiting discounts to 20%, avoiding aggressive sales pushes in the Central region, and reassessing the profit margins on Furniture products. Additionally, ensuring product availability during peak sales seasons is crucial to prevent stockouts.
