‚úÖ Discounts outperform campaigns significantly (97.9% vs 7.4%)

üß® ROOT CAUSE: LOW CAMPAIGN SUCCESS
Customers
1.No clear demographic targeting
2. No retention tracking
3. Over-targeting one segment
Products
1. No bundling strategy
2. Poor timing, product mix, & channel choice
3. Over-reliance on discounts
Strategy
1. No clear campaign metrics
2. Weak historical analysis
3. Lack of re-engagement

üåü SCQA Framework:
1. Situation
Over the past two years (2012-2014), data reveals that Boomers with low working income are the biggest spenders. The company is actively looking for the best promotion method to increase revenue. However, there is a lack of detailed historical data to guide these efforts.
3. Complication ‚ö†
The current marketing strategy is heavily reliant on discounts and campaigns. However, it's unclear if these tactics are effectively contributing to revenue growth in a meaningful way. This uncertainty complicates decision-making, as the company doesn‚Äôt know whether to continue with the existing strategy or pivot to something more effective. ü§î
2. Question
To resolve this issue and make informed decisions, the key questions are:
1. What marketing strategy would be most effective in driving revenue?
2. Which customer segment should be the main focus to maximize impact?
3. Which products should be prioritized to generate the highest returns?
4. When is the optimal time to implement the strategy?
5. Which sales channel is the most effective to target?
Answer 
To effectively drive revenue, use Pareto Analysis (80/20) to focus on the 20% of products and customers that generate 80% of the revenue. This analysis will allow the company to:
- Prioritize the most valuable customer segments, such as Boomers with low working income.
- Focus on the top 20% of products that contribute to the bulk of the revenue.
- Target optimal times for promotions based on purchasing patterns.
- Determine the most effective sales channels (e.g., online, in-store, etc.) to reach the right customers.
